# SharpML

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

SharpML is a proof of concept file share data mining tool using Machine Learning in Python and C#.

The tool is discussed in more detail on our blog here: but is summarised below also:

SharpML is C# and Python based tool that performs a number of operations with a view to mining file shares, querying Active Directory for users, dropping an ML model and associated rules, perfoming Active Directory authentication checks, with a view to automating the process of hunting for passwords in file shares.

Currently it allows for a single file share to be assessed.

You will need to have read access to the file share you are targeting, after which the tool will perform its activities mostly autonomously.


## Usage:
